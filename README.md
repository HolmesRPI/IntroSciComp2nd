These are supplementary files for the text: Introduction to Scientific Computing and Data Analysis (2nd Edition) by Mark H. Holmes

If you want everything that's here, click on the green Code button above and select "Download ZIP." You can then uncompress the various zip files by simplying clicking on them.


The compressed files include the following:

1)  Figures and Tables: this is a folder containing the MATLAB files used to produce almost every figure and table in the textbook.

2) Data Sets and Exercises: this is a folder that contains data files for exercises in the textbook, as well as additional exercises (and accompanying data files)

3) WebPages: webpages for two courses taught with the textbook, which includes the syllabus, assigned homework, exams, etc.  What is missing is the Demo Folder for each course.  This contains the codes used during lecture as well as the lecture. Each of these folders is significantly larger than permitted by Github (I just need to break them down to more digestable sizes, and will do this in the near future).
